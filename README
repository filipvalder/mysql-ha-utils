Configuration instructions
--------------------------

Default values of all configuration parameters are hidden inside the
mhadmin script. If you need to override theese options, place them into a
local configuration file (typically /usr/local/etc/mhadmin.conf). The path
of this file can be set via the $CONF_FILE parameter in the configuration
section of mhadmin.

IMPORTANT: The mhadmin script checks whether the local configuration
file is well-secured or not. Required mode: 600. Required UID: 0.

Installation instructions
-------------------------

 1. Place mhadmin script into a directory containing binaries,
 e.g. /root/bin/.
 2. Run mhadmin by typing mhadmin or ./mhadmin.
 3. If some dependencies are missing, the script stops and announces them.

Operating instructions
